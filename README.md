# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques for Rainfall Prediction ([Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DkIMeXenqMF87nxPRC7wWX6qzVpodgqG/view?usp=sharing))

## ðŸ“œ Project Description
This project presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques for rainfall prediction, focusing on **Mumbai, India**. The study evaluates classical ML models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), alongside a Deep Learning-based neural network model (Multilayer Perceptron - MLP).

The findings demonstrate that the **Random Forest algorithm** achieved the highest accuracy (AUC: 0.9279), while the neural network model exhibited competitive performance. This project aims to improve rainfall forecasting systems for applications like agriculture, urban planning, and disaster preparedness.

## ðŸ“š Dataset

### Source:
The dataset contains historical weather observations from Mumbai, including:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Wind Speed
- Precipitation

### Preprocessing Steps:
1. Handling missing values using mean/mode imputation.
2. Feature engineering:
   - Extracted date/time components.
   - Created new features like daily average temperature, humidity, etc.
3. Defined target variables:
   - `RainToday` (binary variable based on current weather conditions).
   - `RainTomorrow` (lagged target variable for prediction).

For more details on the dataset and preprocessing steps, refer to the `reports/` folder.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated model performance using the following metrics:
1. **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
2. **Precision**: Correctly predicted rain days out of all predicted rain days.
3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Correctly predicted rain days out of actual rain days.
4. **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
5. **ROC-AUC**: Area under the ROC curve.

For more details on these metrics, refer to Section `3.3 Evaluation Metrics` in the report.

## ðŸŒŸ Future Work

Potential improvements include:
1. Using advanced DL architectures like LSTM or CNN-LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies.
2. Extending predictions to rainfall intensity categories instead of binary classification.
3. Incorporating spatial data for geographically weighted predictions.
